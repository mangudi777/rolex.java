The break statement was introduced with the switch statement in order to keep multiple
cases from executing. You can prematurely end other control blocks such as a loop by
executing a break statement. Because you do not want the loop to end each time, the
break statement is placed inside a conditional statement (if). 

Syntax:

break;



import java.util.Scanner;
class main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i;
        int j;
        for(i=1;i<=2;i++){
            
                System.out.println("outerloop"+ i);
            
            
            for( j=1;j<=3;j++){
                
                    System.out.println("innerloop"+ j);
                
            }
        }
        
        
    }
}
