The while loop and do while loop are useful for many situations, but you must control
the boolean condition, ensuring that the variables change and eventually make the
condition false. If you know how many times you want to iterate, the for loop is
probably the best choice. The syntax is as follows:

Syntax:
for (initial_condition; boolean_expression; iteration)
{
 // loop block
}

import java.util.Scanner;
class main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        for(int i=0;i<=10;i++){
        
        
            System.out.println(i);
        
        }
    }
    }


reverse order:
import java.util.Scanner;
class main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        for(int i=10;i>=0;i--){
        
        
            System.out.println(i);
        
        }
    }
    }
